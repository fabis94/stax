## Features

- Full-height stack tree with PR status, sync indicators, and ahead/behind counts
- Selected-branch summary with recommended next actions
- Patch viewer with a compact diffstat header and scrollable patch body
- Keyboard-driven checkout, restack, submit, create, rename, and delete
- Reorder mode for branch reparenting

The main `st` TUI is focused on stacks and patches. Worktree management lives in the dedicated `st wt` dashboard.

## Worktree Dashboard

Run `st wt` in an interactive terminal to open the worktree dashboard.

- Left pane: all Git worktrees, including unmanaged entries
- Right pane: branch/base/path/status details plus tmux session state
- `Enter`: attach or switch to the derived tmux session for the selected worktree
- `c`: create a lane and open it in tmux
- `d`: remove the selected worktree
- `R`: restack all stax-managed worktrees
- `?`: show help
- `q`/`Esc`: quit
- The footer keeps these shortcuts visible and highlights the key itself in the TUI
