# stax

A modern CLI for stacked Git branches and PRs.

## Why stax?

- Blazing fast Rust binary (~22ms `st ls` on a 10-branch stack)
- Interactive TUI with tree view, PR status, diffs, reorder mode, and split mode
- Submit/update complete stacks with correct PR bases in one command
- Transactional history operations with `st undo` and `st redo`
- Freephite-compatible metadata, so existing stacks can be used immediately
